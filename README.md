<h4>Lost & Found</h4>

Our project idea is a geolocation Lost and Found application for android.
If it goes well we can do iOS and website.

* This application will act as a forum to easily post about items you have lost you would like help finding or items you have found that you would like to return to their rightful owner.
* The application will have require an e-mail address for posting and replying to posts and will have an option to make an account with e-mail address and password.
* The app will respond to your location and show you the lost or found items in the area you are in. There will also be an option to check a different area that youâ€™re not in and an option to search for items lost or found.
* Users will be able to post on this app that they have lost an item. The post must have a description of the item, where to return the item/who to contact about it and the option to post a picture of the item. Users will also have the option to post that they have found an item. They can post a picture of it but must have a description of the item * including where and when it was found.

* As an added extra we might add an option for premium users or to buy a premium post to show at the top of all the other normal posts.

* The e-mail option is to moderate the posts and ensure nearly all posts are relevant.
